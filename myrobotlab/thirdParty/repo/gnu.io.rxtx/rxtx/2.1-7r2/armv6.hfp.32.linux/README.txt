Rxtx is "Herding Cats" projects - everyone is a going in all directions.
Finding working binaries is like playing roulette..  slim to none chances of anything stable.
Create-Labs was by far the most impressive offshoot - I have no complaint and only praise for the well thought through, documented, and
normalized process of creating good binaries.  They even were so nice as to make 6 flavors of the binaries.
Unfortunately, they did not create binaries for Arm6 / Raspberry Pi
I found a good set of binaries (of course with a working matching RXTXComm.jar which doesn't match this repos :P) from the
raspberian repo.

So, after this sordid tale, the gist of which is a working arm.32.linux - but with a different jar (extracted from the libraries.zip)
